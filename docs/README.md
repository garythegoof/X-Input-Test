# X-Input-Test
X Input Tester is a free way to check if your X Input Device is working properly.
It supports up to 4 controllers to check.
It is pretty simple, you might need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.
They are provided in the VC Redist Folder.

How to setup:
1. Download as a Zip or TAR
2. Open the Zip or TAR with something like Winrar or 7ZIP for TAR AND ZIP. Alternitivly you can just you windows built in ZIP unpackager.
3. Extract the Files folder first.
4. Try running XInputTest.exe | If it runs Good Job, you don't need anything else.
5. If it doesn't run extract the VC Redist folder
6. Install the contents inside but first read the readme.txt (it will help!)
7. A Restart might be required but otherwise just open XInputTest.exe and it will work fine.

**Note:** 

**When opening you might be brought up with a Windows Defender Smart Screen calling it a threat. It is not but since it is a new program Windows is sceptical of it. Just click "More Info" then "Run Anyway" It will not show up the next time you run X Input Test** | **X Input Test is a Portable EXE which means it does not require an installation and will just be available on the user it was downloaded for.**
